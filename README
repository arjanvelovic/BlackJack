Rules of the Game:
- Object of the Game: Attempt to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21 (bust).
- The Play: The player and dealer are dealt two cards, both the players cards are shown and one of the dealers cards are hidden. The player has the option to 'hit'(ask for another card) or 'stand'(not ask for another card). All the dealer's cards are revealed only when the player stands or goes bust.
- Card Values: An ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.
- Betting: A bet is placed before the deal begins and has a minimum of $2.
- The Pack: This is a six-deck game(312 cards) consisting of standard 52-card decks.
- The Cut: A plastic card is randonly placed between the last 60-75 cards, determing when to reshuffle.
- BlackJack: If the player is dealt 21, the player has struck BlackJack and is awarded 1.5x their bet, unless the dealer also recieves BlackJack in which the game is a draw.

Added Features to Version 2.0
- Splitting Pairs: If the player is dealt a pair they are able to split and treat them as two separate hands. The amount of the original bet then goes on one of the cards, and an equal amount must be placed as a bet on the other card. The two hands are treated separately, and the dealer settles with each on its own merits. With a pair of aces, the player is given one card for each ace and may not draw again. Also, if a ten-card is dealt to one of these aces, the payoff is equal to the bet (not one and one-half to one, as with a blackjack at any other time).
- Doubling Down: The player is able to double their bet if their hand totals 9, 10, or 11. The dealer gives the player just one card which ends the players turn. Note that the dealer does not have the option of splitting or doubling down.
- Insurance: When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, the player may make a side bet of up to half the original bet that the dealer's face-down card is a ten-card. If it is a ten-card, the player insurance bet is paid double the amount
